When you work on your side of the project make sure I am not working on the same thing
  Merg conflics might occure
    If they do, one file or another will be chosen over the other
  Upload frequiently to avoid conflics as much as possible
    The more frequiently you upload the smaller the conflics will be when they happen
  If you are working on testing programming or want to do other things create a new branch and upload there
    All branches will be merged into the main branch
      DO NOT UPLOAD DIRECTLY TO MAIN BRANCH AS STRUCTURAL ISSUES MAY ARISE
To upload project files to GitHub drag and drop into the webpage
  Make sure you are under the correct branch before you upload to avoid issues
Check Projects to update your tasks in progress/completed
  Programming has its own project I left blank so organize it how you like

Work on the project whenever you see fit or are motivated. No Deadline is set for completion of any milestones.

REMEMBER
  Youtube and Unity API are your best friends.
