  Upload frequiently to avoid conflics as much as possible
    The more frequiently you upload the smaller the conflics will be when they happen
  If you are working on testing programming or want to do other things create a new branch and upload there
    All branches will be merged into the main branch
      DO NOT UPLOAD DIRECTLY TO MAIN BRANCH AS STRUCTURAL ISSUES MAY ARISE
To upload project files to GitHub drag and drop into the webpage
  Make sure you are under the correct branch before you upload to avoid issues
Pull Request your work when you are finished and want to add it to the main branch
  Use the Base Dropdown to select the branch you wish to merge your changes into
